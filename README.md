This repository answers the challenge question posed by Swift Navigation on their job application form.  I am specificially applying for the position of Product Engineer, Hardware.

While the position is for a hardware engineer, I have chosen to answer the question in multiple languages because at least three of them are generally required in any position where there is chip development.  Hence, the solution is in SystemVerilog (ASIC/FPGA design and verification), C++ (ASIC/FPGA verification, software firmware and driver), Python (ASIC/FPGA verification, chip/board bring up), JavaScript (because it's cool to have a Web UI to showcase the answer).

You can compile and run the SystemVerilog solution at http://www.edaplayground.com/x/kJc.  I have run the Python version with Python3, compiled the C++ version with g++, and loaded the JavaScript/html version into Google Chrome.

The challenge question is as follows:

# Software, Product, and Embedded Engineering Candidates

In the programming language of your choice, write a program 
generating the first n Fibonacci numbers F(n), printing ...
- ... "Buzz" when F(n) is divisible by 3.
- ... "Fizz" when F(n) is divisible by 5.
- ... "BuzzFizz" when F(n) is prime.
- ... the value F(n) otherwise.

Bonus points for efficient implementation, testing, documentation, 
and/or upload your code to GitHub.
